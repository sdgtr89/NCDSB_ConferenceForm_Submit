# NCDSB_ConferenceForm_Submit
A term long school project for a real world client

The web application allows users to submit expenses for Conferences/Courses they attend to further their career. The app also allows for the applicant to submit forms to track daily mileage totals. Mileage can be added independently or with a conference form.

This app is finished and functioning, however, I am in the process of improving the functionality and separating the application in to more of a layered application.

I will post updates as things get changed!
